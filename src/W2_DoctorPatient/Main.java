/*Create a doctor patient appointment application. We will have a patient class and a doctor class.
The patient will have a name, a disease, and a phone number.
The doctor will also have a name, a specialty, an email and a phone number.
We also need an appointment class which will have the date of the appointment,
the doctor holding the appointment and the patient.
We will also need a clinic class with state: name, and a list of appointments.[list of doctors, list of patients]
 *I want to be able to add doctors & patients, and appointments only for already created doctors & patients.
 **I want to add only 6 appointments per day as my clinic is very small and i want to add only 2 per doctor
 as my doctors are very lazy.
 ***As my business grows i want to add another clinic sharing both the doctors and the patients
 but because this one is bigger i want it to take 10 appointments per day as a maximum
 and because at the new clinic we have coffee
 the doctors are now able to take 3 appointments per day at this clinic.
 Since the doctors are shared, if all their appointments are at the second clinic
 they can have up to 3 appointments, if they are shared or all at the first clinic
 then only 2 appoinments (no coffee, no appointment)*/
